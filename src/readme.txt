There are 5 different solutions in this project

1) Checks all list type values for an entire exact match
3) Checks all list type values for first three matching priorities
4) Checks all list type values for three consecutive matching priorities anywhere in the list
5) Checks all possible combinations of matching priorities

Research needs to be dictate priority order, or existence of at least three priorities in the entire list type values
